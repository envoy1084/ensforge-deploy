Migrate Sepolia ENSv2 to the October 1 deployment snapshot 07e55a05. Update contract addresses and deployed ABIs, export the ENS URI renderers and VerifiableFactory address prediction, and refresh the indexer schema and migration guides. Mainnet behavior is unchanged.

Support idempotent HCA deployment: preserve verification of existing accounts after deployment approval is revoked, reject unapproved new deployments, and report account reuse when deployments race. Recreate Sepolia fixtures and HCA accounts for the new factory, keeping workflow state separate from earlier deployments.

Update the pinned devnet build and preserve the deployed Solidity submodule revisions rather than replacing them with revisions from the stale upstream lockfile.

Require Effect 4 stable (`effect@^4.0.0`) and migrate HTTP and reactivity imports to their new export paths. Upgrade the React Atom integration to 4.0.0 and preserve HCA funding status return types with the updated Effect inference.

Applications upgrading from the release candidate must install `effect@^4` alongside ensforge. Update any direct imports from `effect/unstable/http` and `effect/unstable/reactivity` to `effect/http` and `effect/reactivity`.
